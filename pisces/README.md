## surface model 
two types; particle absorbing and reflecting

## output
- plot particle collisions (number and distribution) with titania tower; the
  interior cylinder
 - x-axis is divided by 'beads' the first one adjacent to the inset
   bottom face is of a different material and size than the remaining beads
- particle positions
- particle collisions over a unit of time for a given boundary triangle
